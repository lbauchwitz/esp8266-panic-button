# esp8266-panic-button
This is a concept of a medical office panic button for the isolated frontoffice secretary
to warn the team in case of an entrance emergency

This project is based on ESP8266

You need
- A momentary Button
- A 10 K Ohms Resistor
- A ESP8266 Dev Board (OpenMCU V3)
- Wires

The C code is a temporary code. It just lights the internal LED for the moment
We will add, in a near future, an internal web server to change the called URL and WIFI SSID/Pass parameters
Function to connect to WIFI Network and call a specific URL

We will also create the 3D printable STL File
